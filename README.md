Hobby project using Cypress

This is my first hobby project using Cypress for the WordPress front-end site https:/www.svalmelo.nl. This is our current soccer club for which I do volunteering work.

To run the tests, you should clone the project and run (default browser is Chrome):

`npx cypress run --headed`

And if you prefer to run headless (without a browser, which is the default option):

`npx cypress run`
